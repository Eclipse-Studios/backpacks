    About 1.21.4...
  </summary>
  <p>
    
The team is already working on the 1.21.4+ update, but due to the changes made regarding the new `item_models` changes it will take some time to update, I hope you understand us.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Important
  </summary>
  <p>
    
This section is for important stuff you should know about the datapack before using it:

### This is a Datapack:
This is important to know because a lot of people end up asking me about stuff that datapacks can't currently handle, like for example REI/JEI support or show the new items in the creative inventory. That's why maybe a feature that is very common in mods isn't really aviable in datapacks or maybe datapacks need workarounds for certain things that may look weird at first glance but once you know why that is like that you understand that it is due to datapack limitations.

### This Datapack DOESN'T support Creative mode:
This means that people in creative mode "can't" use the datapack without "breaking it". What I mean by this is that using the backpacks in creative mode isn't supported due to technical stuff like weird desync behaviour between the server and the client and being able to "place" the backpacks, this last one means that the backpacks are just other items but retextured using a resourcepack, and that items are the following blocks: All 3 types of command blocks, jigsaw block and the structure block (and maybe more in the future). These blocks have been choosed specifically because you can't obtain them in survival and you can't place them unless you are on creative. That's why creative mode isn't really supported.

### Incompatibility with other mods/datapacks/server modifications/etc:
This datapack isn't compatible with the Essential's mod and it is very possible that it may don't work properly on servers that run on Paper. The reason to why this happens is that these two things modify some vanilla commands which breaks a lot of things with this datapack, but this doesn't only affects my datapack, this affects a very big portion of datapacks. I don't mean that they are bad mods or bad server modifications, they are very good projects, it is just that they make this changes which affects a lot of datapacks which is a bit sad tbh. (Also, there may be more mods/datapacks/server modifications which are incompatible with mine so have an eye on that).

### Requires a Resourcepack:
This datapack requires a resourcepack for the textures to appear, if you are using the mod version this doesn't affect you. The resourcepack can be found in the "[Versions](https://modrinth.com/datapack/vanilla-backpacks/versions)" tab > Click on the datapack version you are using (not on the download button) > You should be inside that version > Download the required resourcepack.

    ‚ùì FAQ
  </summary>
  <p>
    
#### Q: Sometimes the items in the backpack flick!

A: Item flickering is caused by a library that we are using, [Sentinel](https://github.com/DefinitelyHighmore/sentinel), which is currently essential for this datapack to work as it allows as to detect when we close a container, how hard items flickers depends on the person, for me it wasn't very much, but for some beta testers was a lot but it is a visual glitch and it doesn't affect gameplay. 

#### Q: Why the items don't have their texture? And why do I have a chest minecart in the head when I'm holding a Backpack?

A: Remember to also download the resourcepack to make it appear that it is not broken, go to "[Versions](https://modrinth.com/datapack/vanilla-backpacks/versions)" > Click on the version you are using > Download the resourcepack.

#### Q: Does this datapack work on older/newer versions?

A: This datapack doesn't work on older versions than 1.20.5, this is because all of the new commands aviable in those versions as well as the new item components format that was implemented in that update. Sadly this datapack won't be backported to older versions.

#### Q: Can I modify the datapack and redistribute it?

A: Yes you can, but only if you say who the original creator is ([Eclipse Studios](https://discord.gg/X2NTE7hkq8)) and if you link the [original Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/datapack/vanilla-backpacks) somewhere noticeable in the project.

#### Q: Are you guys going to make more datapacks?

A: Yes we will, this was ment to be a side project of a more bigger and complex one that the team is doing. For more updates on our future datapacks join [our discord server](https://discord.gg/X2NTE7hkq8)!.

#### Q: Is this datapack compatible with other datapacks?

A: Yes it is. This datapack follows the [Smithed](https://wiki.smithed.dev/conventions/) conventions to ensure datapack compatibility.

    ‚öôÔ∏è Settings
  </summary>
  <p>

Here are all the settings the datapack currently has:
- Blacklisted Items (defaults to true): Makes so a list of items can't enter backpacks, the list is composed of `Backpacks` and `non-empty Shulker Boxes` by default. 

<details>
  <summary>
    How to customize it
  </summary>
  <p>
This setting can be customized by modifying the predicate located at `data/backpacks/predicate/settings/blacklisted_items/list.json`, but `non-empty Shulker Boxes` are sadly hard coded so to remove it simply go to the file `data/backpacks/function/cmd/settings/blacklisted_items/check/main.mcfunction` and change the following line:
   
```mcfunction
execute unless predicate backpacks:settings/blacklisted_items/list unless items entity @s container.* #shulker_boxes[!minecraft:container=[]] run return fail
```

with this one:

```mcfunction
execute unless predicate backpacks:settings/blacklisted_items/list run return fail
```
  </p>
</details>
    
All these settings can be found when doing `/function backpacks:cmd/settings/list` in-game.

    üñ•Ô∏è Commands
  </summary>
  <p>

You can give yourself a Backpack with the following command:

```mcfunction
/function backpacks:give/backpack/tiers/(tier)
```

You can also give yourself an Ender Backpack like this:

```mcfunction
/function backpacks:give/backpack/enderchest
```

You can also create a custom backpack with a simple command! Here's how:

```mcfunction
/function backpacks:give/backpack/custom {item_id:"",model_data:0,slots:0}
```

- item_id: The item id (example: `"minecraft:stone"`)
- model_data: A custom model data (example: `1234`)
- slots: The number of total slots (example: `41` or if you want the backpack to be linked to your enderchest: `"enderchest"`)

This is an example command:
```mcfunction
/function backpacks:give/backpack/custom {item_id:"minecraft:stick",model_data:0,slots:100}
```

That would give you a stick with 100 total slots and a custom model data of 0.

Here's the full list of custom model datas and their item ids if you want to use one of the backpacks model:

    üóëÔ∏è Uninstall
  </summary>
  <p>
    
To unistall the datapack run `/function backpacks:cmd/uninstall` before removing it from the datapacks folder, that will remove all scoreboards and more stuff that the datapack uses.

| Note: The unistall function doesn't unistall the [Sentinel](https://github.com/DefinitelyHighmore/sentinel) library because other datapacks may be using it too. |
